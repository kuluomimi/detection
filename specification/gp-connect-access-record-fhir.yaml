    ## Overview

    Use this API to access structured and coded information from a person’s GP practice record to consume in a person facing service. The API accesses GP principal supplier systems and provides a consistent interface and data model.
    An account must be set up by the person with NHS Login P9 identity verification level to gain access to their GP practice record.

    A person or consumer system can retrieve data from GP practice records for the following areas:

    - medications
    - allergies
    - immunisations
    - consultations
    - problems
    - investigations
    - attachments
    - uncategorised data (other clinically coded items that are present in the record)

    Common use cases include:

    - access your digital medical record for better self- management of care

    - understand your GP record in completeness to support making informed decisions with health professionals about your health.

    - view links between parts of the record e.g. for a given problem, understand what consultations took place, medications are prescribed, and letters recorded.

    You cannot currently use this API to:

    - write back to the GP record

    | Production       | Not yet available

    We have 2 testing streams:

    clinical testing

    technical testing

    Each stream is complicated in its own right and we've designed them to run in parallel to help you to work with us more easily and to consider your system design in a holistic way, rather than having to complete one stream before the other.

    ### Clinical testing

    The aim of clinical testing is to ensure the safe interoperability of information exported from GP systems and then processed or displayed in a consuming system. 

    To help you test that your consuming system is clinically safe, we have created the following resources:

    a patient record or, for some more complex areas, 2 records that can be requested from the GP Connect demonstrator

    a description of each of the data items, what it is intending to test and the hazards that it is intended to mitigate

    notes and guidance about each clinical area that describe how to process and display the data that it contains in a safe way

    ### Technical testing

    The purpose of technical testing is to help you assure the messaging capability of your system via the Spine with GP Connect provider FHIR endpoints. It ensures the consumer requests conform to FHIR standards as per the specification. In addition, it maintains the integrity of the data displayed to the user and assures pertinent functional requirements. It does not assure the message payload, which is covered in clinical assurance.

    See[Consumer Supplier Test Assurance for achieving Technical Conformance](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpc-consumer-support/wiki/Document-library#consumer-supplier-test-assurance-for-achieving-technical-conformance) (PDF) for full details of the technical conformance process and relevant artefacts.

    ## Onboarding

    ### Expressing an interest

    If you meet the prerequisites and have a product that can integrate with GP Connect person facing services, you should express an interest with us by submitting a use case.

    The main purpose of the use case is to help us understand how you plan to use GP Connect person facing services APIs and the business issue you are looking to address. You should email your use case to the GP Connect team.

    Your use case should include the following information as a minimum:
    - the business problem you are intending to solve using GP Connect
    - how GP Connect will be used to benefit patients and staff
    - which of the GP Connect products you will use to benefit patients and staff
    - any end-user organisations you are currently working with
    - who your clinical safety officer is and, where available, your clinical risk management process documentation

    Once we receive your use case, we'll respond within 14 days.

    ### Consumer assurance process

    On approval of a use case, we will support you through the assurance process through to go live. We will discuss the assurance process and artefacts with you to help you understand the requirements.

    Start your development work within 6 months of use case approval. If you miss this date, a review or new submission of the use case will be required. Changes or additional development will also require a review or new use case submission. For full details of the technical conformance process, see GP Connect Consumer Supplier Test Assurance for achieving Technical Conformance (PDF).

    ### Clinical assurance process

    We are here to support you to develop clinically safe systems in line with your responsibility to achieve the relevant [DCB0129](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems)or[DCB0160](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems)clinical safety standards. 

    The three stages of the clinical assurance process for GP Connect Access Record: Structured consumers

    We host a series of meetings to help you develop clinically safe systems:

    - initial meeting
    - clinical safety process readiness review meeting
    - clinical evaluation of readiness for deployment meeting

    For more information, see Clinical assurance process details.

    Additional guidance: Clinical safety and hazard log

    ### Clinical safety approach

    Your organisation must have a clinical safety officer. Information standards underpin national healthcare initiatives from the Department of Health, NHS England, the Care Quality Commission, and other national health organisations. They provide the mechanism for introducing requirements to which the NHS, those with whom it commissions services and its IT system suppliers, must conform.

    The following two standards relating to clinical safety are accepted for publication under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 by the Data Coordination Board (DCB). In line with current DCB practice, each standard comprises:

    a specification, which defines the requirements and conformance criteria to be met by the user of the standard - how these requirements are met is the responsibility of the user

    implementation guidance, which provides an interpretation of the requirements and, where appropriate, defines possible approaches to achieving them

    Compliance with[DCB0129]((https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems))and [DCB0160](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems) is mandatory under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 ([Clinical risk management standards - NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/clinical-safety/clinical-risk-management-standards)).

    [Consumer Implementation Guidance](https://simplifier.net/guide/pfs-implementation-guide/Home/FHIR-Assets/Profiles.page.md?version=current)

    ### Clinical safety guidance

    The [Guide for Access Record: Structured](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpc-consumer-support/blob/master/Clinical%20Safety%20Officer%20Guidance%20for%20GP%20Connect%20V0.6%20Structured.pdf) helps clinical safety officers assure GP Connect consumer systems into their own organisations. It includes details of the clinical safety standards that consumer suppliers and their commissioning organisations must be compliant with ([DCB0129]((https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems))and [DCB0160](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems)).

    [Clinical safety principles](https://github.com/nhsconnect/gpc-consumer-support/wiki/Clinical-Safety-Principles) shows you who is responsible for the clinical safety of GP Connect specifications and consumer systems.

    ### Hazard log

    The GP Connect Access Record: Structured generic hazard log shows you the clinical risks of using GP Connect functionality through a consumer system. Use it to identify the clinical risks of consuming clinical data and presenting it in your system, and record these in your own system-specific hazard log. If necessary, take mitigating action to ensure clinical safety.

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action

    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.
